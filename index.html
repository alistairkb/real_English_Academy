				<h2>Life in Zhanjiang</h2>
				<p>Zhanjiang lies at the southernmost tip of the Chinese mainland, located between tropical Hainan Island and the economic powerhouse of the Pearl River Delta. Zhanjiang is famous throughout China for its seafood – the freshest available, fruits, and
					year-round mild sub-tropical climate. From 1898 to 1946, Zhanjiang (then known as Fort Bayard) was the administrative seat of the French colony of Guangzhouwan. Art Deco and colonial architecture from the French period can still be found in the Chikan
					district of Zhanjiang.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Zhanjiang, eating and drinking on verandas overlooking the bay is way of life! Seafood is fresh, fabulous and ubiquitous. Come and experience a new life in China at the Real English Academy! The city and beaches are waiting for you!

				<ul class="actions stacked">
					<li>Zhanjiang Offshore Islands – local beaches and resorts</li>
					<li>Chikan – Unrestored French colonial architecture</li>
					<li>Beihai – China’s winter playground and burgeoning beach resort</li>
					<li>Kaiping – UNESCO World Heritage Site with 18th-20th century castles and fortifications known as Diaolou</li>
